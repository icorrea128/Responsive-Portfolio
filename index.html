                            Hello!
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Thank you for visiting my page. My name is Ismael Correa. I am based out in Chicago, Illinois. This website will guide you through some of the projects that Iâ€™ve worked on. If you would like to collaborate on any projects, please reach out to me in the contact section of my page. Currently, I am working on achieving my certificate in full-stack web development at the Northwestern Coding Bootcamp. Upon completion of this program, I plan to develop web applications with friends who are interested in engaging in entrepreneurial activities. 
                        <p>
                            The journey to entrepreneurship is tough but we plan on rolling out prototypes in November. If you are interested in being a part of a team that is engaging in tech entrepreneurship then come join us! Our main area of expertise is going to hopefully be in backend development. I plan on becoming even more well-versed in python throughout the duration of the program at Northwestern. This means we are looking for those individuals who are also well versed in backend-development in order to compliment our strengths. 
                        </p>
                        <P>
                            Currently, we do have a team of individuals who have their particular strengths but we hope to meet more interested individuals in the coming months. Once again thank you for visiting my personal portfolio page, I hope to hear from you soon.
                        </P>
