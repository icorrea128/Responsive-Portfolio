                        <p>
                            Welcome to my portfolio page. These are projects that I have developed so far. Ideas are still in the pipeline and I hope to accomplish these soon.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Thank you for visiting my page. My name is Ismael Correa. I am based out in Chicago, Illinois. I have front-end and back-end experience with HTML, CSS, Javascript, JQuery, AJAX, MongoDB, Express, React.js, Node.js, MySQL, Firebase, Django, Python, and R. 
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Currently I am developing a financial web application that will have a front end structure, and server, generated by fellow fraternity brother. The backend framework through Django and data science predictive models will be generated by another set of fraternity brothers, including me.
                            I am a Financial Services Representative at a firm called MassMutual Illinois. This role has given me the ability to help individuals achieve their financial goals through providing sound financial solutions. We offer investments, insurance, and financial planning. 
                        </p>

                            This portfolio demonstrates finished products. On the contact page, you can find my github in the event that you would like to review all of my projects. Also, feel free to connect with me on LinkedIn.
