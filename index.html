                            Welcome to my portfolio page. These are projects that I have developed so far. Ideas are still in the pipeline and I hope to accomplish these soon.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Thank you for visiting my page. My name is Ismael Correa. I am based out in Chicago, Illinois. Previously, I was a financial services representative at MassMutual Illinois. I learned about the value in financial services through providing life insurance to eighty individuals. I also developed life insurance contracts through salesforce that provided an individual with capital for home acquisition and also provided cash value during retirement. Currently, I am studying for the SIE and Series 7 and am licensed in life insurance and accident and health. 
                        </p>

                            Currently I am developing a financial application through Django. The application will include a value at risk view, qqplot view, sharpe ratio view,single index model view, beta view, alpha view, auto regressive view, moving average view, and an auto regressive heteroskedasticity view. The application will work off of apis that will be called in order to provide the application with real time data.
